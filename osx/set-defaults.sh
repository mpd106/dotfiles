# Sets reasonable OS X defaults.
#
# Or, in other words, set shit how I like in OS X.
#
# The original idea (and a couple settings) were grabbed from:
#   https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx
#
# Run ./set-defaults.sh and you'll be good to go.

# Show the ~/Library folder.
chflags nohidden ~/Library

# Set a really fast key repeat.
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0

# Run the screensaver if we're in the bottom-left hot corner.
defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-bl-corner -int 5
defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-bl-modifier -int 0

# Sensible key bindings for quitting stuff
defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents '{"Quit Google Chrome" = "@$Q"; "Quit iTerm" = "@Q";}'
